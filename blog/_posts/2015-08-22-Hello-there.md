#### Hey there welcome on my blog.

If you don't know what this blog is about, I invite you to read the [about]( {{ site.baseurl }}/about.html) section.

> So What's going on here ?

We will talk mostly about gamedev and C++ programming, but maybe other langages too (I think there will be some articles on D, and in the future rust and Jai).

> What kind of articles will we see ?


A little bit of everything, tutorials, thoughts, presentations, why not news and certainly some random stuff.
