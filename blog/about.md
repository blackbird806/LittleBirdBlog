### About me

Hello there, my name is Grégoire Penon, and I'm a game developer and programmer from France.  
I program / make games since 2014 and today I'm student in video game programming in Paris.  
I started programming in C++ which is now my favourite langage, but I also like C, assembly, C#, lua, moonscript, Go and D.  
I also love gamejams, I made several games for the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) (which is awesome !).  
I mostly like sandbox, rpg, mmo and strategy games but I appreciate all kind of games.

### The blog 

Here you will find articles mostly on C++ and video game programming, but I may write on other subjects too.
I created this blog in order to share my knowledge; In my learning experience I found that a lot of topics in game dev / programming are hard to find and that's why I want to change this. Another motivation for this blog is for my own learning process and I think that teaching is a great way to understand.
